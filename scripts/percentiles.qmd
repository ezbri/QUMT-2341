## Percentiles

-   Interpret what an nth percentile means in plain language.

-   Use quantile() correctly with probability values.

-   Connect numeric percentiles to the distribution of real data.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
data(faithful)
```

```{r}
head(faithful)
# View(faithful)
summary(faithful)
```

## Guess

Where do you think the 32nd percentile might fall? What about the 98th percentile?

```{r}
hist(faithful$eruptions, breaks = 20)
```

## Calculate and Interpret

```{r}
duration <- faithful$eruptions
```

```{r}
quantile(duration, .32)
```

```{r}
quantile(duration, c(.32, .57, .98))
```

## Visualization

```{r}
hist(duration, breaks = 20,
     main = "Eruption Durations (minutes)",
     xlab = "Duration")

abline(v = quantile(duration, .32), col = "firebrick")
abline(v = quantile(duration, .57), col = "steelblue")
abline(v = quantile(duration, .98), col = "darkgreen")
```

## To try on your own

Find the 17th, 43rd, 67th and 85th percentiles of the eruption **waiting periods** in `faithful`
